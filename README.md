# Mathematical Foundations of Signal Processing @ EPFL
## Homework
The homework is mostly based in theoretical problems related to the material seen in the lecture.
Homework 2 also have an implementation part that is included as a jupyter notebook.

## Labs
1. Finite dimensional linear inverse problems: A geometrical perspective
2. A Functional Data Analysis Framework for Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
3. Recovering signals with Finite Rate of Innovation (FRI)

A simple tomograpaphy example provided by the professors is also included in this folder.
