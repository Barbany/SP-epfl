    "# Tomographic reconstruction from a rectangular array\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will go from setting up a model of tomographic measurement to reconstructing an attenuation distribution from noisy beam measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The domain in which the attenuation distribution is reconstructed is rectangular, of given width and length. In the particular example that you will work with, this domain is square of length 1 meter, but length and width could have any value. You can assume that the lower-left corner of the reconstructed domain is the origin itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with algebraic reconstruction, so the first thing that you probably want to do is to discretize the domain by representing it as a weighted sum of basis functions. To make things simple, we suggest you choose basis functions with the shape of a disc whose radius $r$ is related to interpixel distance $d$ by $r = \\tfrac{d}{\\sqrt{2}}$, as illustrated in the figure below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"grid_round_pixels.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "We also suggest to model beams as infinitely thin lines, such that the inner product between the k-th pixel and i-th beam, $\\langle \\phi_k, h_i \\rangle$, equals the length of the beam's segment that lies inside that pixel, as illustrated in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"beam_and_round_pixel.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the exercise, you will construct the measurement matrix $A$. In order to help you achieve this, we suggested to implement a few functions that can be used to that end; however, if you prefer to do it differently, you're welcome to take your own route.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beams are lines defined by their endpoints, given in two matrices: **beam_start** and **beam_end**. Each is of size $n_{\\it beams}\\times 2$, where $n_{\\it beams}$ is the number of beams. The i-th row of **beam_start** contains the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the start of beam $i$, while the i-th row of **beam_end** contains the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the end of beam $i$. Those two matrices should be enough for you to determine the line parametrization, given by $(\\theta_i,t_i)$, of every beam. If you forgot, $\\theta\\in[0,\\pi)$ is the angle of the line normal, while $t$ is the signed distance of the line to the origin, along the direction defined by $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you have computed the line parameterization for all the beams, you can compute the inner products $\\langle \\phi_k, h_i \\rangle$ mentioned above by finding the length of the intersection between beams and round pixels. With those, you have everything you need to populate the measurement matrix $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the measurement matrix $A$, you should be able to reconstruct the pixel values. The vector with measurements, which we denoted by $b$ in the slides, is given in the variable called **measurement**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms for algebraic reconstruction were described in the lecture and have been shown in the application session. To simplify your life, we provide a separate file **helpers.py** with some of the functions that have been given to you in the solution to the application session, but you're welcome to use the one that you were given earlier this week."
